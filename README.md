# üöÄ XLSX-Progress-Tracker

**XLSX-Progress-Tracker** is a **lightweight Node.js server** built with **Express** that allows users to upload, manage, and track the reading progress of Excel files (XLSX). It provides a simple API to handle file uploads, retrieve file data, and maintain persistent reading states with row-specific comments.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **File Uploads** ‚Äì Users can upload XLSX files, which are securely stored in the dedicated `uploads` folder.
* **Persistent Progress Tracking** ‚Äì Track which rows of an XLSX file have been read. Progress data and comments are stored in a persistent JSON file (`read-progress.json`) without requiring a database.
* **Row-Level Annotations** ‚Äì Users can attach **comments** to specific rows of the uploaded Excel file.
* **Simple & Extensible API** ‚Äì Built with **Express** and configured with **CORS** for seamless cross-origin support, utilizing **Multer** for robust file upload handling.
* **Zero Database Dependency** ‚Äì File uploads and read progress data are stored directly in server directories (`uploads` and `data`), making setup quick and simple.
